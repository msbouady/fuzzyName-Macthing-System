Turning complex data into clear insights, one fuzzy match at a time.

###########################################

This project is designed to compare names between two Excel files using fuzzy matching techniques. 
The goal is to label the names according to their status ('admis', 'sortant', 'entrant') based on their presence or absence in both files.

--Features--
The project loads two Excel files specified by their paths and cleans the names to remove special characters and create variations for more accurate matching. The complete name columns from both files are converted into fuzzy sets, allowing for flexible comparison.

Each name from the first file is compared with the names in the second file using fuzzy matching. If a match with a sufficiently high score is found, the name is marked as 'admis'. If no match is found, the name is marked as 'sortant'. Similarly, names from the second file are compared with those in the first file. If a match is found, they are marked as 'admis'. If no match is found, they are marked as 'entrant'.

--The results are then converted into new Excel sheets and saved as new files.

--Instructions
Ensure Node.js is installed and install the necessary modules (xlsx and fuzzyset.js) using npm. Specify the paths to the Excel files in the script and run the script to generate new Excel files with updated name statuses.
